Thirty eight percent of people in the Philippines live in slums, unable to provide a suitable living for themselves and their family. They cannot afford basic living expenses or other essentials that determine their quality of life. 
                     My goal was to contribute to the solution of ending poverty though a fundraiser, with all the proceeds going towards The Good Samaritan Sisters Early Learning Projects in the Philippines. This organisation aims to help lift young children out of poverty by providing the education that families are unable to afford. Money donated is used to provide chlidren with life skills, literacy, numeracy, and other skills to create a better future needed to create a better future for themselves and their family.

                    Through the project I learnt more about the causes of the disease and the effect it has on many Australians. I gained a deeper understanding about the importance of healthy eating and good nutrition. I also learnt about the correct daily intake of different nutrients. This became a key part of my project as I included the Nutritional Value Tables for each recipe.</h4>

                                Our international students have graduated with extraordinary success stories. A contributor to that success is our belief that each girl can only become her best self when she feels well supported and comfortable in her environment. That’s why we choose to take responsibility for each girl’s welfare arrangements and strive to get to know each girl and her needs.
